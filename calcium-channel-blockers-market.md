<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Calcium Channel Blockers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Blockers</li><li>Non-Selective Blockers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are categorized into two main types: selective and non-selective blockers. Selective blockers specifically target L-type calcium channels, primarily affecting cardiac and smooth muscle tissues, making them suitable for treating hypertension and angina with minimal side effects. In contrast, non-selective blockers affect various calcium channels throughout the body, potentially offering broader therapeutic effects but increasing the risk of side effects. This classification helps guide healthcare providers in choosing the appropriate therapy for patients based on their specific needs.</p></p>
