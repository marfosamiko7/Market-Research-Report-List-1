<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Front Windscreen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Laminated Glass</li><li>Tempered Glass</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The front windscreen market primarily comprises laminated and tempered glass types. Laminated glass features a layer of polyvinyl butyral (PVB) sandwiched between two glass layers, providing enhanced safety, sound insulation, and UV protection. It's designed to prevent shattering, keeping shards intact during impacts. Tempered glass, on the other hand, is heat-treated to increase strength and resilience. When broken, it shatters into small, less harmful pieces, reducing injury risks. Both types cater to different vehicle safety and design requirements in the automotive sector.</p></p>
