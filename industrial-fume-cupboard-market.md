<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Fume Cupboard Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Ductless Fume Cupboard</li><li>Ducted Fume Cupboard</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The industrial fume cupboard market is primarily divided into two types: ducted and ductless fume cupboards. Ducted fume cupboards are connected to an external ventilation system, effectively expelling hazardous fumes outside, making them suitable for high-risk environments. In contrast, ductless fume cupboards use built-in filtration systems to purify the air and recirculate it back into the laboratory, ideal for settings where external ventilation is impractical. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining safety and air quality in industrial and laboratory settings.</p></p>
